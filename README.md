# conway-racket
A racket implementation of conway's game of life and applying it to have some fun :)
## Projected Development
* Use [HashLife algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HashLife) to make better and faster simulations
* Multiple topological options for grids
* Function for efficiently translating the pattern on grid to other places
* Enriched simlulator experience
* Insitu grid editing options
* `grid->rle` converter?
* Credits: Thinking of reverse-timing the credits... whatyasay?
* Football still remains a mystery
